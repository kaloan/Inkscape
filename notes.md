# Constuctions

- Rhombus is done by intersecting two triangles.
- Straight line horizontal/vertical by bezier + hold \<Ctrl\> (which is used to restrict angle to nearest 15deg).

# Object operations

- Division results in intersection + rest of the object on the lowest level.
- Set operations change color to the one of the object on the lowest level.
- Object &#10140; Transform for exact translation and rotation.

# Environment
- Preferences &#10140; Tools &#10140; Select "Geometric bounding box".
- Snapping is disabled by default. Use the UI on the right to work with it.
- To add new layer: Object &#10140; Objects &#10140; \<Right-click\> on any in the list &#10140; Add layer...
- Layer &#10140; "Move selection to [...]" to easily move between layers.
- Copy-Paste pastes the entire selection to the current layer!
- \<Ctrl-D\> to duplicate right on top of the same object. Duplicating preserves layers!
- \<Ctrl-Alt-D\> to clone - all changes to original item also cascades to its clones. Cloning preserves layers!
